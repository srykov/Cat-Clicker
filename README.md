# Cat Clicker
This is an application that I developed as part of my Udacity [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The lesson required me to iteratively build my own version of [Kitty Clicker] (www.kitty-clicker.com/). The requirements for the application changed iteratively, and the finished product of each set of requirements is captured here in a different branch.

## What I Learned
I wrote the javascript, HTML and CSS. This lesson highlighted the pitfalls of building an application using vanilla javascript and HTML, and set the stage for learning Javascript frameworks. 

Specifically I practiced:
* using DOM selectors
* using event listeners
